# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing their symbols (traditionally X and O) on the empty spaces in the grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

The game can end in one of two ways:

A player gets three of their symbols in a row, in which case they win the game.
All spaces on the grid are filled without either player getting three in a row, in which case the game ends in a tie.
Tic Tac Toe is a simple and fun game that can be played virtually anywhere with just a pen and paper. It is a great way to pass the time and sharpen your strategic thinking skills.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The game uses HTML to structure the game board, which is a 3x3 grid of squares. CSS is used to style the game board and the symbols (X's and O's) that are placed in the squares. JavaScript is used to handle the game logic, including keeping track of which squares are occupied and determining the winner of the game.

When the game starts, all squares on the game board are empty. The first player (either X or O) is determined randomly. Players take turns clicking on empty squares to place their symbol in the square. JavaScript is used to keep track of which squares are occupied and to ensure that a player cannot place their symbol in an occupied square.

After each turn, JavaScript checks to see if there is a winner. If a player has three symbols in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then they win the game. If all squares on the game board are occupied and there is no winner, then the game ends in a tie.

When the game is over, JavaScript displays a message indicating the winner (or tie) and provides an option to play again. CSS is used to style the message and the play again button.

Overall, the Tic Tac Toe game is a fun and challenging project that demonstrates the power and versatility of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating interactive and engaging web applications.


<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:
Understanding the game logic is essential: Tic Tac Toe has simple rules, but understanding the game logic is essential to ensure that the game works as expected. It's important to keep track of which squares are occupied, to check for a winner after each turn, and to handle ties correctly.
